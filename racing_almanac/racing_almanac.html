        <h3>Therminology</h3>
        <h4>F1</h4>
        <p><b><u>DRS(Drag Reduction System)</u></b> - Formula 1 cars have front and rear wings that create downforce, improving tire grip in corners but reducing straight-line speed due to increased air resistance. Since 2011, drivers can activate the DRS from the steering wheel, which temporarily reduces the rear wing’s angle. This change lessens aerodynamic drag by allowing airflow to pass more freely, boosting the car’s speed by up to 12 km/h on straights.</p>

        <h4>NASCAR</h4>

        <p><b><u>Lucky Dog</u></b> - A NASCAR rule allowing the first driver who is a lap behind during a yellow flag to overtake the pace car and rejoin the tail end of the main pack. This helps the driver regain a lap but does not improve their actual position in the race order.A NASCAR rule allowing the first driver who is a lap behind during a yellow flag to overtake the pace car and rejoin the tail end of the main pack.

        <p><b><u>Apron</u></b></b> - The flat, inner part of a racetrack that separates the banked turns from the infield area where the pit lane is located. Drivers use the apron to safely exit the banking and enter the pit lane. It is marked by a white line, and overtaking is often restricted when a driver goes beyond this line.</p>

        <p><b><u>Bump Drafting</u></b> - A technique in track racing where a trailing driver lightly pushes the rear bumper of the car ahead to give it extra momentum. This action increases the speed of both cars.A technique in track racing where a trailing driver lightly pushes the rear bumper of the car ahead to give it extra momentum.

        <p><b><u>Slipstream</u></b> - Driving closely behind another car in its turbulent air zone, which reduces air resistance for the trailing car and slightly for the leading car. Slipstreaming conserves fuel, delays pit stops, or helps drivers accelerate and overtake. However, it reduces cornering ability and engine cooling for the driver behind.</p>

        <p><b><u>Drafting</u></b> - A racing technique where a car follows closely behind another to reduce aerodynamic drag, often involving gentle pushing of the lead car. This is essentially similar to slipstreaming.</p>
